## Analysis scripts to generate Figs. S3 and S6 in Hong et al. 2025 paper

Fig. S3: \
chiron_visualization.ipynb: generates Fig. S3a-b, d (visual comparison between loop callers) \
gen_pr_curves.py and plot_pr_curves.py: generate fig. S3b (quantitative comparison between loop callers)

Fig. S6: \
downsampling_analysis.py generates the fracshift calls on downsampled data shown in S6 c-d \
downsampling_analyze.py generates the plots for S6c-d \
get_union_set.py matches chiron and mustache loops for S6b \ 
fracshift_analysis.Rmd performs the CTCF ChIP summit analysis and generates S6b

The methods section of the paper describes how data used in these analyses were generated, and they can be provided 
upon request.
